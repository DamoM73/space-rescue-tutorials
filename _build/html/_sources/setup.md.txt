# Setup

For this course we are going to using a proper development environment with version control. We will need to install a number of programs and then set our environment to ensure it functions properly.

## Programming Language - Python

The first step is to install Python our programming language. If you have been using educational IDEs like Thonny and Mu, Python normally came packaged with them. This is not normally the case.

```{admonition} Versions
:class: note
Python has many versions. At the time this site was created, Python 3.11.4 was the latest verion. This won't be the case for very long, since a new version of Python 3 comes out every year. It doesn't matter too much for the level we are working, so just go ahead and install the latest one.
```

The best way to install Python depends on the operating system you are using.

### Windows

The easiest way to install Python on Windows devices is to use the **Microsoft Store**. Just search for Python and then select the latest version (at the time of writing it is 3.11). This will install Python as well as keeping it up to date, when patches are released. It also add Python to your computer path, this allows it to be used anywhere on your computer.

### macOS

To install Python for macOS go to the [Python homepage](https://www.python.org/) and click the yellow button that says **Download Python 3.X.X**. The website will detect your operating system and download the correct file for your computer.

Now install the downloaded file.
