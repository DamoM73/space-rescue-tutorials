# Game Design

There are general principles which help create better games. In fact there is an entire industry dedicated to the design of games. There is heaps of academic research into gamer's preferences and how to influence gamers. So the material we cover here, is a really simple introduction into a topic so big that it can cover a range of different careers.

The question is, what makes a good game? Is it the graphics and sound or something else?

## Game Mechanics

Game mechanics are the basic rules and interactions that make games fun to play. If games were a car, then game mechanics are like the engine. The graphics, characters, storylines and music are like the bodywork. It doesn't matter how good the bodywork is, if your engine is poor, so is the car performance.

The best games have great game mechanics, superb graphics, believable characters, spectacular music and compelling storylines, but it is the mechanics that make games stand out from other media. Movies can also have superb graphics, believable characters, spectacular music and compelling storylines. Books can have believable characters, and compelling storylines.
