# Game Design

There are general principles which help create better games. In fact there is an entire industry dedicated to the design of games. There is heaps of academic research into gamer's preferences and how to influence gamers. So the material we cover here, is a really simple introduction into a topic so big that it can cover a range of different careers.

First, what makes a game a game?

## Interactive Challenges

Games can be described a interactive challenges, detailing the two prerequisites aspects - interactivity and challenge. Take either of these aspects away and you no longer have a game.

### Interactivity

**Interactivity** means that players have some control over the outcome. They provide input and then the game interacts with the input to produce outcomes. The input could be pressing a button, or moving a mouse, or even rolling a dice (this game definition isn't limited to computer games).

Without interactivity the game becomes some for of passive entertainment, like watching a movie or reading a book.

### Challenge

Games normally have their own set of **challenges** that the player needs to overcome to win. This could be explicit like quests or implicit through scoring for completing tasks.

Without challenge the game becomes play, like playing with a toy.

The question is, what makes a good game? Is it the graphics and sound or something else?

So we know games need both interactivity and challenge, but how do we incorporate these to create a good game.

## Game Mechanics

Game **mechanics** are the basic rules and interactions that make games fun to play. Mechanics are how we incorporate both interactivity and challenge to produce our game. If games were a car, then game mechanics are like the engine. The graphics, characters, storylines and music are like the bodywork. It doesn't matter how good the bodywork is, if your engine is poor, so is your car's performance.

The best games have great game mechanics, superb graphics, believable characters, spectacular music and compelling storylines, but it is the mechanics that make games stand out from other media. Movies can also have superb graphics, believable characters, spectacular music and compelling storylines. Books can have believable characters, and compelling storylines.

We are going to look at eight basic mechanics, four that address challenge and four that address interactivity. They are:

| Challenge | Interactivity |
| --- | --- |
| Difficulty | Choices and Control |
| Goals | Control Overload! |
| Rewards | Unfair Punishment |
| Subgoals | Audio Feedback |

### Challenge Mechanics

Different players want different kinds of challenges. **[Quantic Foundry](https://quanticfoundry.com/)** is a market research firm who specialises in assessing games. Below is their model detailing 12 different motivations for why gamers enjoy playing games.
